Election Website Scraping
I utilized the Scrapy open-source framework to extract data from an election results website. To enhance manageability and reduce complexity, I divided the main Python script into four distinct modules: "Parliamentary State-wise Results," "Parliamentary Party-wise Results," "Assembly Results," and "By-election Results."

One of the primary challenges I encountered was effectively accessing and extracting data from select buttons, followed by navigating through each corresponding URL to gather the necessary information. Despite these challenges, I successfully managed to retrieve and organize the data.

For data analysis and visualization, I employed pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for generating insightful visualizations. This approach not only allowed me to gain practical experience in web scraping and data visualization but also provided valuable insights into real-world data handling.

Working on this project was both stimulating and rewarding, as it provided me with a hands-on understanding of scraping techniques and data processing methodologies. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills to solve new challenges and eager to explore emerging technologies in the field.
